# QGIS Resources

This is a collection of QGIS symbols, styles, and scripts.

## How to use

Please use this download link to download the collection: https://github.com/anitagraser/QGIS-resources/zipball/master

Of course you can also use Git. This way, you can easily update to the latest versions of all styles.

## Contribute

Feel free to send pull requests if you want to add to this collection. 
Until the QGIS project gets dedicated infrastructure for sharing symbols 
and styles, I think this could be a good way to go.
